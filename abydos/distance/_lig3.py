class LIG3(_Distance):
    r"""LIG3 similarity.

    :cite:`Snae:2002` proposes three Levenshtein-ISG-Guth hybrid similarity
    measures: LIG1, LIG2, and LIG3. Of these, LIG1 is identical to ISG and LIG2
    is identical to normalized Levenshtein similarity. Only LIG3 is a novel
    measure, defined as:

        .. math::

            sim_{LIG3}(X, Y) = \frac{2I}{2I+C}

    Here, I is the number of exact matches between the two words, truncated to
    the length of the shorter word, and C is the Levenshtein distance between
    the two words.
