    """Inclusion distance.

    The INC Programme, developed by :cite:`Bouchard:1980` designates two
    terms as being "included" when:

        - One name is shorter than the other
        - There are at least 3 common characters
        - There is at most one difference, disregarding unmatching
          prefixes and suffixes

    In addition to these rules, this implementation considers two terms
    as being "included" if they are identical.

    The return value, though a float, can only take one of two values:
    0.0, indicating inclusion, or 1.0, indication non-inclusion.
