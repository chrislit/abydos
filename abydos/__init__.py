Abydos NLP/IR library by Christopher C. Little


There are nine major packages that make up Abydos:

    - :py:mod:`.compression` for string compression classes
    - :py:mod:`.corpus` for document corpus classes
    - :py:mod:`.distance` for string distance measure & metric classes
    - :py:mod:`.fingerprint` for string fingerprint classes
    - :py:mod:`.phones` for functions relating to phones and phonemes
    - :py:mod:`.phonetic` for phonetic algorithm classes
    - :py:mod:`.stats` for statistical functions and a confusion table class
    - :py:mod:`.stemmer` for stemming classes
    - :py:mod:`.tokenizer` for tokenizer classes

Classes with each package have consistent method names, as discussed below.
A tenth package, :py:mod:`.util`, contains functions not intended for end-user
use.
