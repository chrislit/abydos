        Parameters
        ----------
        scaler : None, str, or function
            A scaling function for the Counter:

                - None : no scaling
                - 'set' : All non-zero values are set to 1.
                - 'length' : Each token has weight equal to its length.
                - 'length-log' : Each token has weight equal to the log of its
                   length + 1.
                - 'length-exp' : Each token has weight equal to e raised to its
                   length.
                - a callable function : The function is applied to each value
                  in the Counter. Some useful functions include math.exp,
                  math.log1p, math.sqrt, and indexes into interesting integer
                  sequences such as the Fibonacci sequence.
        flags : int
            Flags to pass to the regular expression matcher. See the
            `documentation on Python's re module
            <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.A>`_ for details.
