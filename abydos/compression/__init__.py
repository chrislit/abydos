r"""abydos.compression.

The compression package defines compression and compression-related functions
for use within Abydos, including implementations of the following:

        - :py:class:`.Arithmetic` for arithmetic coding
        - :py:class:`.BWT` for Burrows-Wheeler Transform
        - :py:class:`.RLE` for Run-Length Encoding


Each class exposes ``encode`` and ``decode`` methods for performing and
reversing its encoding. For example, the Burrows-Wheeler Transform can be
performed by creating a :py:class:`.BWT` object and then calling
:py:meth:`.BWT.encode` on a string:

>>> bwt = BWT()
>>> bwt.encode('^BANANA')
'ANNB^AA\x00'
