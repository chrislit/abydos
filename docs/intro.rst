Abydos is a library of phonetic algorithms, string distance measures & metrics,
stemmers, and string fingerprinters.

-----

Installation
============

Required libraries:

- NumPy
- deprecation

Optional libraries (all available on PyPI, some available on conda or
conda-forge):

- `SyllabiPy <http://syllabipy.com/>`_
- `NLTK <https://www.nltk.org/>`_
- `PyLZSS <https://github.com/rumbah/pylzss>`_
- `paq <https://github.com/observerss/paq>`_


To install Abydos (master) from Github source::

   git clone https://github.com/chrislit/abydos.git --recursive
   cd abydos
   python setup install

If your default python command calls Python 2.7 but you want to install for
Python 3, you may instead need to call::

   python3 setup install


To install Abydos (latest release) from PyPI using pip::

   pip install abydos

To install from `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/abydos>`_::

   conda install abydos

It should run on Python 3.5-3.8.

Testing & Contributing
======================

To run the whole test-suite just call tox::

    tox

The tox setup has the following environments: black, py37, doctest,
regression, fuzz, pylint, pydocstyle, flake8, doc8, docs, sloccount, badges, &
build. So if you only want to generate documentation (in HTML, EPUB, & PDF
formats), just call::

    tox -e docs

In order to only run & generate Flake8 reports, call::

    tox -e flake8

Contributions such as bug reports, PRs, suggestions, desired new features, etc.
are welcome through Github
`Issues <https://github.com/chrislit/abydos/issues>`_ &
`Pull requests <https://github.com/chrislit/abydos/pulls>`_.

Badges
======

The `project's main page <https://github.com/chrislit/abydos>`_ has quite a
few badges, some seemingly redundant, and a bit of explanation is perhaps
warranted.

- CI & Test Status

    - `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/chrislit/abydos>`_ is the primary CI
      used for Linux CI of all supported Python platforms (2.7-3.8-dev). Only
      the tests in the tests directory are run.
    - `CircleCI <https://circleci.com/gh/chrislit/abydos/tree/master>`_ runs
      only the Python 3.6 tests on Linux and is used for quick tests of each
      commit.
    - `Azure DevOps <https://dev.azure.com/chrislit/abydos/_build/latest?definitionId=1>`_
      is used to perform tests on Linux, MaxOS, and Windows on Python 2.7,
      3.5, 3.6, & 3.7 using pytest.
    - `Semaphore <https://semaphoreci.com/chrislit/abydos>`_ is used to run
      the tests in the tests directory, doctests, regression tests, and fuzz
      tests.
    - `Coveralls <https://coveralls.io/github/chrislit/abydos?branch=master>`_
      is used to track test coverage.

- Code Quality (some may be removed at a later date)

    - `Code Climate <https://codeclimate.com/github/chrislit/abydos>`_ is used
      to check maintainability, but mostly just complains about McCabe
      complexity.
    - `Scrutinizer <https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/chrislit/abydos/>`_ is used
      to check complexity and compliance with best practices.
    - `Codacy <https://app.codacy.com/project/chrislit/abydos/dashboard>`_ is
      used to check code style, security issues, etc.
    - `CodeFactor <https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/chrislit/abydos>`_
      is used to track hotspot files in need of attention.

- Dependencies

    - `Requires.io <https://requires.io/github/chrislit/abydos/requirements/?branch=master>`_
      tracks whether Abydos can be used with the most recent releases of its
      dependencies.
    - `Snyk <https://snyk.io/test/github/chrislit/abydos?targetFile=requirements.txt>`_
      tracks whether there are security vulnerabilities in any dependencies.
    - `Pyup.io <https://pyup.io/repos/github/chrislit/abydos/>`_ tracks updates
      and security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    - `CII Best Practices <https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1598>`_
      identifies compliance with Core Infrastructure Initiative best practices.

- Local Analysis

    - `Pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_ score, run locally
    - `flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ score, run locally, should
      be 0.
    - `pydocstyle <https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle>`_ score, run locally,
      should be 0.
    - `SLOCCount <https://dwheeler.com/sloccount>`_ shows the total source
      lines of code.
    - `Black code style <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_ signals that Black is
      used for code styling.

- Usage

    - `Read the Docs <https://abydos.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ hosts
      Abydos documentation online.
    - `Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/chrislit/abydos/master?filepath=binder>`_
      provides an online notebook environment for the demo notebooks.
    - `GPL v3+ <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0>`_ is the license used by
      Abydos.
    - `Libraries.io <https://libraries.io/pypi/abydos>`_ assigns a SourceRank
      to indicate project quality and popularity.

      citation information for Abydos.

- Contribution

    - `OpenHub <https://www.openhub.net/p/abydosnlp>`_ tracks project activity
      and KLOC and estimates project value.
    - The commit activity shows commit rate.
    - The issues badge indicates the number of issues closed.
    - The GitHub stars badge indicates the number of stars received.
